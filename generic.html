            Hi everyone! In this page I dive into some of the details of the
            work I've been doing and my portfolio projects. I'll go through each
            project and explain the technologies I used, and my journey through
            each project.

          <h3>Short & Sweet</h3>
          <p>
            Full Stack Developer with real world experience using React, Vue,
            CSS and multiple other frontend technologies plus a background in
            strength & conditioning coaching. As a kid I was in love with
            science and technology and that enthusiasm fell off when I started
            studying computer science in college. After a year hiatus from
            higher education I decided to give coding another shot. My
            experience in strength programming lent itself to immersion in Ruby
            on Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux. Meanwhile my experience in
            building client relationships evokes relentless drive to problem
            solve. I have since applied these skills to my role as a frontend
            developer at Tango Analytics, fullstack engineer doing freelance and
            now hope to bring my skills to another company to grow and learn
            more!
