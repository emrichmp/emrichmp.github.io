									<h2><a href="#">Background</a></h2>
									<p>Emrich took his first coding course in his junior year of highschool. That sparked a passion to pursue
										Computer Science at Syracuse University and Computer Systems at City Tech. With a declining passion for STEM
										Emrich took a step away from coding but found that passion again during the pandemic with the FlatIron School. Besides
										spending countless hours learning Full Stack Web Development, Emrich has also spent his time building his powerlifting coaching
										business, where he has developed a skill to build strong client relationships with people. He loves to work and help people. Besides
										engineering Emrich loves to compete in powerlifting, play with his dog Kilo and explore the city. New York City born and raised, Emrich
										has spent the past 2 years in Los Angeles California as a frontend developer at Tango Analytics
										and is now looking to move back home to New York City and find work in Software Development in the NYC area or work remotely.

						<h2><a href="#">Career</a></h2>
						<h3> The Story </h3>
							<p>
								After I graduated from the FlatIron School in June 2021, I moved from New York City to Los Angeles and began my job hunt. I spent months interviewing with
								companies and kept getting to the later rounds of the interview process and it was frustrating. The search for that first position in software is tough. It's
								a never ending battle of cold outreach's, people who don't follow up when they said they would, and No's. However, I learned from my time at The FlatIron School
								that consistency and determination is key (corny I know, but it's true!). But after months of rejection I was finally offered a 3 month trial internship with 
								Tango Analytics as a Software Developer UI Intern. I then spent the next 3 months learning a ton and I can split this up into 2 categories, technical 
								and working in corporate. I added VueJS (2.0 and 3.0) and Quasar to my front-end framework toolkit. I also increased my skills as a debugger ten-fold. 
								I was shown many tricks and methods to going about debugging the front-end map product and now have a much deeper understanding of how to use the chrome 
								developer console to my advantage. In addition, I also picked up typescript and learned how to migrate an entire web application from one framework version to another.
								 On the corporate side of things, I learned all about how teams can operate and work together. I learned to always be in 
								communication with my superiors and keep them updated/ask them for help to stay efficient. I was able to finally get a taste of what it was like to be a software 
								engineer. After the trial was over, I received a return offer from Tango Analytics to be a Full-Time Salaried Jr. Software Developer. Since then the team has grown 
								and I have continuted to hone the skills mentioned above and more!
							</p>
						<h3> The Technical </h3>
							<p>
								So I figured that whomever is reading this might also be interested in hearing what I've learned so far and the more technical things I've done since starting my software career. 
								So I wanted to outline that here in a way where I'm not breaking my NDA. I first started out by self teaching myself Vue2, Vue3 and Quasar. 
								This is because I entered the company just as they were trying to migrate the entire platform to the newest version of the front-end frameworks we use. So I have spent my time since then
								taking components from the older version of the code and changing them to the newest version syntax and then debugging from there to make sure the components acted the same way. I spent much 
								of my time debugging and I think I've actually grown to enjoy it. I learned how to use breakpoints and check the network tab to see how and when data is being called. I would also interact with 
								the dev console in breakpoints to check the values of certain variables to make sure the code was functional. We are now just getting to making reported bug fixes and are mostly finished with 
								the migration project!
							</p>
						<h3> What Now? </h3>
							<p>
								Currently, I am very happy with my current position, however I am now putting out feelers again. I would like to continue to work on myself as a software engineer and desire a role with more collaboration
								and more creation. Even though I do love debugging I miss the creating part of software engineering. I miss making a whole app or even adding features. I would love to do more of that in my next role 
								because I feel like that is when I enjoy software engineering the most. I love making things, however I still absolutely love the feeling of solving a bug and would love for my next role to include 
								problem solving in that sense too!
