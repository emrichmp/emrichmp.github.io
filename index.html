              <h2>Who am I?</h2>
              <p>
                I am a half-filipino Software Engineer, Powerlifter and Coach originally from Queens, 
                New York! For the past 2 years I have been living in Los Angeles chasing my goals as a developer and a powerlifter!

              <h4>Developer Background</h4>
              <p>
                I started my dev journey as a frontend development UI Intern at Tango Analytics, which led to me being promoted to 
                Jr. Frontend Developer until Tango and I parted ways in March '23. In December '22 I started building my Upwork account, which lead to me landing my first
                project my first month. After spending more time building my account and sending numerous proposals
                I landed 4 projects in March '23 and then my first long term "higher rate" project in May '23 building an app for OFTV.
                Since then I have spent my time working as an LGTV and Vue Developer for Goyk Productions working on the OnlyFans extension OFTV.
                In addition, I have started builing out Ourmada (a web3 tool) using both frontend and backend technologies which has given me so much room
                to grow an excel as a developer. Given this journey, I am super proud of my growth as a developer; Starting as an intern teaching myself TypeScript and 2 versions of both 
                Vue & Quasar to builing full scale high traffic frontend & fullstack applications has been quite the journey.
              </p>
              <h4>What do I do Outside of Work?</h4>
              <p>
                I'm glad you asked! Let's break it down...
              </p>
              <a href="https://ibb.co/Kq8MMyx"><img class="fun_image" src="https://i.ibb.co/hWTPP8F/meetdaysquat.jpg" alt="meetdaysquat" border="0"></a>
              <p>
                I spend a lot of my time as a Powerlifter and a Powerlifting Coach! Having as many as 13 clients, I have spent a lot of time guiding others through
                training and through competitions. I provide meet day coaching for my athletes and connect with them once a week, just like my Upwork clients!
                For my own goals, I track my macros and train 4-5 times a week. Currently my all time PR numbers are 
                452 lbs Squat, 330 lbs Bench and 525 lbs Deadlift. I hope to hit 500/363/585 by the end of 2024!

              <p>
                I love to cook food! Growing up in a Filipino house-hold, I loved watching my mom cook and picked up cooking skills from watching her!
                Since Late 2019 I have been a home cook and have experimented with all types of cuisine! I've found it super fun to utilize cooking techniques
                I've learned online to enhance the flavor of more "macro-friendly" foods! In addition, I love cooking for friends/family and just successfully cooked/hosted
                my 3rd friendsgiving! I love cooking French, Italian, Asian and Mexican cuisine!
              </p>

              <p>
                I love to stay active and I am a huge walker! I also have played tennis since I was 7 years old and you can catch me tearing it up at Echo Park at least
                once a week! I love biking around as well! Biking around both LA and NYC has been a great past time for me and I have done the 5 borough bike tour for 5 
                seperate years! In addition, I love finding ways to express myself artistically!
              </p>
              
              <h4>What Now?</h4>
              <p>
                Now I plan on continuing this journey with the same goal I've had as a developer my whole career: "I want a role that pushes me and gives me the opportunity to <u>learn</u>"
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently looking to pick up a new frontend/fullstack role and eventually move back to New York to work in-office, hybrid or remotely.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you would like to get in touch with me to talk business or discuss interests/ask for advice please feel free! I love connecting with people!
